# Reinforcement Learning Algorithm
In this repository, I have collected the differents reinforcement learning algorithm developed during Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree Program.

- `DP_Methods.ipynb`: Some implementations of many classical dynamic programming algorithms to solve the [FrozenLake](https://github.com/openai/gym/blob/master/gym/envs/toy_text/frozen_lake.py) environment.  

- `DeepQ-Learning_Algorithm.ipynb`: Teaching an agent to play games using Deep $Q$-Learning Algorithm. To ilustrate, I have used this algorithms to teach an agent to play [Cart-Pole](https://gym.openai.com/envs/CartPole-v0).

- `MC_Methods.ipynb`: Teaching an agent to play  [Blackjack](https://github.com/openai/gym/blob/master/gym/envs/toy_text/blackjack.py) using differents Monte Carlo Methods.

- `TD_Methods.ipynb`: Implementation of many Temporal-Difference (TD) methods for solving Markov Decision Process (MDPs). For ilustrate, and testing the differents algorithms I have solved the [CliffWalking](https://github.com/openai/gym/blob/master/gym/envs/toy_text/cliffwalking.py) environment.

In `DDPG_ActorCritic_Method`folder, there are an Actor-Critic Methods implementations, an similar scheme that I have used to teach a quadcopter to take off (see [RL_Quadcopter
](https://github.com/jcarlosgm30/RL_Quadcopter) repository).

## Enviroments used:
The enviroments used to apply the differents reinforcement learning algorithm are described in the differents notebook, similarly the algorithms used to solve them.

These environments have been implemented through [Gym](https://gym.openai.com/). It is a toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms. 

## Instructions
The instructions of using of each algorithm is described in its notebook.
