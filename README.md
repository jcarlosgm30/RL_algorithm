# Reinforcement Learning Algorithm
In this repository, I have collected the differents reinforcement learning algorithm developed during Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree Program.

`DP_Methods.ipynb`: Dynamic Programming methods to solve FrozenLake Environment
`DeepQ-Learning_Algorithm.ipynb`: Teaching an agent to play games using Deep $Q$-Learning Algorithm
`MC_Methods.ipynb`: Teaching an agent to play Blackjack using Monte Carlo MethodsÂ¶
`TD_Methods.ipynb`: Reinforcement Learning using Temporal-Difference Methods

In `DDPG_ActorCritic_Method`folder, there are an Actor-Critic Methods implementations.
